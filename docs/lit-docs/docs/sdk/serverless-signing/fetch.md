# Fetching Data from the Web within a Lit Action

## Overview

Unlike traditional smart contract ecosystems, Lit Actions can natively talk to the external world. This is useful for things like fetching data from the web, or sending API requests to other services.

This Lit Action fetches the current temperature from the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/) API. It will only sign the given message if the temperature forecast exceeds 60째F (15.5째C). By incorporating the API request and response logic directly within the Lit Action, you eliminate the need for a third-party oracle.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of [PKPs](../../../user-wallets/pkps/overview)
- Basic understanding of [Lit Actions](../serverless-signing/quick-start)

## Complete Code Example

The complete code example is available in the [Lit Developer Guides Code Repository](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/tree/master/lit-action-using-fetch). There you can find a Node.js and browser implementation of this example code.

### Example Lit Action

The `signEcdsa` function returns a boolean value stored in the `sigShare` variable. It's `true` if the message is successfully signed, and `false` if an error occurs during the Lit Action. If the temperature is below 60째F (15.5째C), the Lit Action will instead return a response message to the user.

```jsx
const _litActionCode = async () => {
  try {
    const url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast";
    const resp = await fetch(url).then((response) => response.json());
    const temp = resp.properties.periods[0].temperature;
    console.log("Current temperature from the API:", temp);

    if (temp < 60) {
      Lit.Actions.setResponse({ response: "It's too cold to sign the message!" });
      return;
    }

    const sigShare = await LitActions.signEcdsa({ toSign, publicKey, sigName });
    Lit.Actions.setResponse({ response: sigShare });
  } catch (error) {
    Lit.Actions.setResponse({ response: error.message });
  }
};

export const litActionCode = `(${_litActionCode.toString()})();`;
```

## Important Considerations
You can use fetch() inside a Lit Action to write data, but caution is necessary. The HTTP request will execute multiple times, once for each Lit Node in the network.
When writing data, it's crucial to use operations that produce the same result regardless of how often they're repeated. Consider these examples:

1. Repeatable operation (preferred):

- SQL Update: Running it multiple times only changes the row once.
- Result: Consistent outcome, regardless of repetition.

2. Non-repeatable operation (avoid):

- SQL Insert: Each execution creates a new row.
- Result: Unintended duplicates with multiple executions.

For Lit Actions using fetch() to write data, aim for repeatable operations. This approach prevents issues like duplicate entries or unintended changes if the request repeats due to network conditions or distributed execution across nodes.

## Summary
This guide demonstrates how to fetch data from the web within a Lit Action.
