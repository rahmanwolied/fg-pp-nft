# What is Lit Protocol

<StateOfTheNetwork/>

Giving private keys or credentials to a server is a massive security responsibility. 

Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management network for programmable signing and encryption. The network empowers developers to create secure, decentralized applications that manage crypto assets, private data, and user authority seamlessly across platforms.



Lit’s threshold cryptography architecture ensures secrets remain verifiably secure—air-gapped and encrypted at the hardware level—while being fragmented and distributed across a decentralized network. For the first time, universal accounts can be programmed without trusting centralized custodians.
Using Lit’s SDK, developers can easily [encrypt data](../sdk/access-control/quick-start.md), [create and manage Web3 accounts](../user-wallets/overview.md), [generate digital signatures](../intro/first-request/making-first-signing.md), execute blockchain transactions, and implement virtually any signing or encryption operation.

Builders leverage these capabilities to develop immutable, interoperable, and user-owned apps, agents, and protocols. Existing ecosystem applications include AI-driven agents, cross-chain DeFi solutions, universal solvers, private user-controlled accounts, and decentralized data marketplaces.

Learn more about [How Lit Works](../resources/how-it-works.md).

Lit Protocol fills a missing layer of the Web3 “stack” by taking on secret management and making it into a computing primitive for builders with a fault-tolerant, and programmable network. Lit Protocol helps secure our digital interactions and data, facilitates greater interoperability between on and off-chain systems, and eliminates centralized points of control.

## Use Cases
The programmable signing and encryption capabilities provided by the Lit network can be used by developers to support the following use cases.

:::note
For a more comprehensive list of example projects, check out the [Lit Ecosystem page](../../Ecosystem/projects). 
:::

**Universal Accounts**: Lit Protocol enables the creation of universal accounts that can operate seamlessly across any blockchain network, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and beyond. The underlying private keys are managed by the decentralized Lit network, meaning these wallets are fully programmable and always non-custodial. Developers can use this to build user wallets, orchestrate liquidity across isolated networks, enable transaction automations (e.g. dollar-cost-averaging), and more.

Examples: [Emblem Vault](https://circuitsofvalue.com/), [CollabLand](https://collab.land/), [Genius](https://www.tradegenius.com/), [Tria](https://tria.so/), [Eco](https://eco.com/).

**Private Data**: The Lit network can be used to implement encryption and access control for any use case that demands privacy. Builders can use [access control conditions] to manage access rights for relevant stakeholders according to the policies you set.   

Examples: [Verify (Fox Corp)](https://www.verifymedia.com/), [Streamr](https://streamr.network/), [Cheqd](https://cheqd.io/), [Index](https://index.network/).

**Agent Wallets**: [Vincent](https://docs.heyvincent.ai/) is a framework and open standard that enables the creation of autonomous, verifiable, and user-controlled agents. Built directly on top of Lit’s core infrastructure, Vincent enables agents to securely manage keys, sensitive data, and other secrets. Developers building agent runtimes and other agent-powered applications can use Vincent to manage their agents’ keys and create “tools” (using [Lit Actions](../sdk/serverless-signing/overview.md)) custom built for specific actions and operations (e.g. dollar-cost-averaging). 

For end users, Vincent serves as a marketplace for discovering these agentic apps and tools, while giving them the ability to set fine-grained permissions that govern the specific actions agents can take on their behalf when interacting with each (i.e. spending limits or time intervals for DCA).
